- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @remy-devweb
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about ReactJS and developping a personal project with it
- ðŸ“« I know some basics on Magento, GatsbyJS, Prismick and GraphQL
- Do you need me to learn a css framework ? No Problem, I worked with Tailwind and it was pretty cool!
- I can use PHP and some frameworks like Laravel or Symfony but I'm not a fan on backend web development so I'm more interested about Javascript's frameworks !
